# Multi-Agent Marketing System ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository contains a **multi-agent system for automated marketing**, built using **LangGraph**. The system leverages **React agents** that collaboratively plan, execute, and evaluate marketing campaigns. The agents utilize real-time **Tavily web search** to ensure access to the latest information and provide cutting-edge strategies for campaign design. The system also supports API integration for enhanced functionality, and API keys are stored securely in environment variables.
