## Overview
This project is designed to revolutionize marketing strategy using AI Agents . Built using LangGraph, this system leverages multiple specialized agents to perform key tasks like company research, project planning, content creation, and campaign generation. By integrating Tavily for real-time web search and utilizing powerful LLMs like LLaMA 3.3 70B through Groq for faster inference, this system ensures cutting-edge performance and up-to-date insights. Whether it's developing marketing strategies or generating comprehensive campaign content, the system empowers businesses with automation, scalability, and unparalleled intelligence.
